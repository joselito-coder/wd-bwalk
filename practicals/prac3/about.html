			<div class="about-content-data">
				Dr.Joline’s clinic is a place where people like you discover how they can become the healthiest version
				of themselves. Our patients have amazed themselves and those around them by making simple, naturalistic
				changes to their lifestyle.
				The clinic was set-up in the year 2016, but my interest in the power of nature to cure health issues
				began when I was much younger. Even as a young teenager I was amazed at how particular food could
				trigger specific responses in my body. In my quest to understand natural healing of the body I have
				completed my Bachelor’s in Homeopathic Medicine & Surgery (Goa), Diploma in Nutrition & Health
				(Ahmedabad), Post Graduation in Hospital & Healthcare Management (Symbiosis, Pune), Post Graduation in
				Medicolegal Systems (Symbiosis, Pune), and Clinical Nutrition Therapy ( Stroud, London).
				My treatments give you one on one attention. I help my clients understand their unique body types. Post
				that, we work together to achieve their goals to lose weight, to improve cholesterol, or to balance
				their hormones. No one diet fits all. I simplify the diet for my clients. I believe in adding more local
				rather than exotic fruits and vegetables to my client’s diet.
				I treat patients with disorders like diabetes, hormonal imbalance, obesity, arthritis, cardiometabolic
				disorders, low immunity, gender-specific health issues, PCOD, infertility, thyroid-related disorders,
				gastric disorders, stress management among others.
